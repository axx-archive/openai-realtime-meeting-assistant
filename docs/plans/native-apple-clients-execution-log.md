# Native Apple Clients - Execution Log

Date created: 2026-06-24
Primary plan: `/Users/ajhart/Downloads/PLAN.md`
Branch: `main`

## Goal

Implement native Apple clients as first-class peers on the existing
MeetingAssist Go/Pion room while preserving browser parity. The first shipped
increment is the native protocol foundation, buildable Apple Swift package, and
tests that prove native clients can discover, authenticate, enter signaling,
and compile shared client modules.

## Agent Loop

- Goal owner: main Codex thread coordinates implementation, validation, staging,
  commit, and push.
- Server contract agent: inspected Go auth/config/websocket seams and confirmed
  the minimal additive backend scope.
- Native Apple scaffold agent: inspected Apple tooling and recommended a
  package-first foundation before installable app bundle targets.
- Reviewer gate: block any claim of native quality/stability improvement until
  physical iPhone, iPad, and Mac media proof exists.

## Wave 1

Status: `wave1_foundation_checkpoint_validated`

Scope:
- Add native protocol metadata while preserving browser `/client-config`.
- Add a native roster/config endpoint.
- Document the native room protocol.
- Add Go contract tests for native discovery, websocket admission/media-ready,
  answer, candidate, `restart_ice`, and `select_layer`.
- Add a buildable Apple package/workspace foundation with shared modules/tests.

Files changed:
- `.gitignore`
- `main.go`
- `auth_http_test.go`
- `websocket_auth_test.go`
- `participants_test.go`
- `docs/native-apple-protocol.md`
- `apple/`

Validation:
- `go test ./...` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- `swift test` passed in `apple/`.
- `node scripts/media-fix-verification.mjs` passed 21 checks.
- `node scripts/voice-focus-benchmark.mjs` passed with no failures.
- Local temporary-room smoke passed:
  `node scripts/live-media-smoke.mjs --url http://127.0.0.1:3100 --participants Tom,Caitlyn --timeout-ms 100000`.
- Local `GET /native/config` returned `native-room-v1`, cookie auth paths, seven
  roster participants, and the `/client-config` plus `/websocket` room paths.
- Focused native websocket contract tests passed:
  `go test ./... -run 'TestWebsocketNative' -count=1`.
- VPS runtime env was copied into ignored local `.env.local` with `0600`
  permissions for validation/local parity. Secret values were not printed and
  are not committed; available names include `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `MEETING_TURN_SECRET`, `MEETING_TURN_URLS`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and
  `BONFIRE_RUNNER_TOKEN`.
- `swift test` initially failed with `stasel/WebRTC` 149.0.0 because the copied
  macOS framework could not import `WebRTC/RTCAudioSource.h`.
- The foundation package was adjusted to keep WebRTC behind
  `MeetingAssistRoomRTC` without linking the binary in Wave 1.
- `xcodebuild -list -packagePath .` is not supported by the installed Xcode
  26.5, and the workspace currently exposes no shared command-line schemes.

Risks / blockers:
- Package-first Apple foundation is not yet an installable iOS/macOS app bundle.
- Xcode app targets/schemes and simulator test gates remain Wave 2 work.
- Physical-device media proof is still required before claiming video quality or
  stability improvement.
- Private Scout Realtime voice was not exercised in the browser smoke; the VPS
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` is now available locally through ignored `.env.local` for a
  later explicit Realtime validation pass.
- Real TestFlight/App Store submission is out of scope for this commit.

What worked:
- Keeping `/client-config` additive avoids breaking the browser client.
- Deriving the native roster from `meetingParticipantNames` keeps room admission
  and native login discovery aligned.
- Treating WebRTC behind `MeetingAssistRoomRTC` keeps the binary dependency from
  leaking into higher-level app modules.
- Validating the binary package during this wave exposed a concrete macOS
  header/import issue before it could destabilize every Apple module.
